# WordGuessingV1.1
A project I made thanks to the method given by the course "Code in Place" of Stanford University. 
It is a game that consists in guessing a randomly assigned word.
I called it V1.1 because, beside the base game, I added the possibility for users to customize the number of attempts
and to choose whether to play again or not.
In addition, some little changes were made for a better UI with all the texts.

# WordGuessingV1.1
A project I made thanks to the help of Stanford University with the course (Code in Place). It's a game that consist to guess a random assigned word.
I called it V1.1 because in addition to the base game, I added the possibility for User to customize the Initial attempt it can have and the possibility to
choose if to play again or not.
And made some little change for a better UI with all the texts.
